<p class="block">This is a paragraph. <span class="inline">It has a span element, an inline element wide enough to fit this contents. It's styled with a background color of red and a <em>BIG</em> margin of 30px that only show at the left and right.</span><em class="inline">This is an em element, another inline element with embedded italics. It was styled with a background color of gray. It has a small padding of 3px.</em></p>

<div>This is a div, a block element. It takes up all the available width. It was styled with a black background color and white font color.</div>

<em><p>By the way, never put a block element inside an inline element like this, ya dummy.</p></em>

<p><em>Do it like this instead, smartypants ;). Says who? The teacher <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/user/taptapkaboom">Rich Armstrong</a> whose Skillshare profile I've just linked with another inline element, the a element.</em></p>

<h1><span>Heading 1</span></h1>


<p>Look at this input element. It's inside a paragraph tag and looks like an inline element, but <input type="text"> the margin, border, and padding apply vertically. <span>Just look at how the input box push away the span and text on ALL sides, not just left and right. This block is now <em>SO</em> much bigger than the rest!</span></p>
